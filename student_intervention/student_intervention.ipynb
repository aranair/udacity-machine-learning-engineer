    "  - A special case of generalized linear model that is primarily only used for classification (despite the name)\n",
    "  - Widely used in medical sciences to predict mortality for injured patients, risk of strokes etc. \n",
    "  - In general also used to find the probablity of X given multiple features/variables as in multivariate logistic regressions.\n",
    "- Advantages:\n",
    "  - A well-behaved classification model that is good to start with to use as a baseline\n",

    "\n",
    "The number of training data sample is relativey few whereas the dimensionality of the data is rather high. That is the reason I chose SVM as the first model as SVMs generally performs well even in high-dimensionality. Computationally, it is on the high side at **~O(n^2)** but it remains to be seen how much higher it is compared to the other models.\n",

    "The second model I chose is an ensemble of decision trees: Random Forest. Decision trees in general do not have the constraint of needing linearly separable datapoints and are (generally) fast but tends to overfit. Random forest ensemble method helps with the overfitting issue and generally does well in alot of data sets so I felt that it should be evaluated to see how well it would perform in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, I wanted to also include a simpler model: the logistic regression because of the limitations in resources. It somewhat belongs to a different *type* of algorithm compared to the other two in the sense that it is just a statistical regression model. It is simple to visualize, efficient and provides a pretty good baseline to compare other algorithms with."

The SVM approach take significant computation to train and predict as compared to the other 2 models. \n",

    "Judging from the how the random forest is over-fitting on the training data while still having a relatively low test score, I feel that that I'll probably need to tune the model by increasing the number of trees involved via *n_estimators* and consequently the complexity of the random forest which means the time-complexity will surely increase: **O(v\\*nlog(n))** The viability of the model, given our limited computation resources, is lowered because of this. \n",

It is also extremely efficient and consumes very little computational power and memory to train and predict compared to the other two more complex algorithms. The scores on the training set seem reasonably close to the other two algorithms too. Another consideration is that, as the training set is expected to grow steadily over a decade, overfitting becomes less of a issue for logistic regression eventually, thus the results will only get more accurate. On top of that, the school can also back-track and find the estimated regression coefficients of a log scale and interpret the effects of each feature in future to help with developing the intervention.\n",
