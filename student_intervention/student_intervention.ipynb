    "- General application: \n",
    "  - A special case of generalized linear model that is primarily only used for classification (despite the name)\n",
    "  - Widely used in medical sciences to predict mortality for injured patients, risk of strokes etc. \n",
    "  - In general also used to find the probablity of X given multiple features/variables as in multivariate logistic regressions.\n",
    "- Advantages:\n",
    "  - A well-behaved classification model that is good to start with to use as a baseline\n",

    "\n",
    "The number of training data sample is relativey few whereas the dimensionality of the data is rather high. That is the reason I chose SVM as the first model as SVMs generally performs well even in high-dimensionality. Computationally, it is on the high side at **~O(n^2)** but it remains to be seen how much higher it is compared to the other models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second model I chose is an ensemble of decision trees: Random Forest. Decision trees in general do not have the constraint of needing linearly separable datapoints and are (generally) fast but tends to overfit. Random forest ensemble method helps with the overfitting issue and generally does well in alot of data sets so I felt that it should be evaluated to see how well it would perform in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, I wanted to also include a simpler model: the logistic regression because of the limitations in resources. It somewhat belongs to a different *type* of algorithm compared to the other two in the sense that it is just a statistical regression model. It is simple to visualize, efficient and provides a pretty good baseline to compare other algorithms with."

However, given the constraints of limited resources, I think we should favor simpler approaches. The SVM approach take significant computation to train and predict as compared to the other 2 models. \n",

It is also extremely efficient and consumes very little computational power and memory to train and predict compared to the other two more complex algorithms. The results on the test set seem reasonably close to the other two algorithms after fine-tuning too. Also, as the training set is expected to grow steadily over a decade, overfitting becomes less of a issue for logistic regression eventually, thus the results will only get more accurate. On top of that, the school can also back-track and find the estimated regression coefficients of a log scale and interpret the effects of each feature in future to help with developing the intervention.\n",

    "**Answer: ** Logistic regression works similar to a linear regression model but is used only when the dependent variable is categorical, e.g. whether a student passes or fails. There is a *link* function which is defined as the log of odds: ln(P/1-P) where P is the probability of a student passing. This provides the model with the continuous value that is used for standard linear regression. Fitting the data refers to the same as linear regression analysis e.g. minimizing the error between expected value and actual via the *link* function. This yields the coefficients, or significance of each feature and a predictor function (fitted model). When making a prediction, the value obtained via the predictor function is converted back via an exponential function (reverse of log) to obtain the probability that the expected value is a 1 or 0 (pass or fail).
